CTA Smart recebe aporte da Indicator Capital e Marcopolo para aprimorar o seu sistema e expandir internacionalmente,"<p id="""">  A Indicator Capital, gestora brasileira de venture capital early-stage, e a Marcopolo, por meio de seu braço de corporate venture capital e novos negócios, MarcoZero, dedicado a monitorar, estruturar e investir em oportunidades na área de mobilidade, anunciam o investimento inicial de R$ 5,5 milhões na CTA Smart, empresa de tecnologia do segmento de combustíveis com foco em sistemas de automação e controle de abastecimento. A previsão é que, com um segundo aporte previsto para ocorrer em até 18 meses, o investimento possa atingir até R$ 19 milhões.</p><p id="""">Com base em Porto Alegre e nos Estados Unidos, a CTA Smart é detentora de uma tecnologia de sistemas inteligentes para abastecimento de frotas com base em um modelo de SaaS (Software as a Service). A plataforma estará acessível para a gestão do combustível de empresas de todos os portes e segmentos do Brasil e do mundo, com robustez e facilidade de instalação remota.</p><p id="""">O alinhamento da CTA Smart com a tese de Internet das Coisas foi um dos fatores determinantes para o investimento da Indicator Capital. Já para a MarcoZero, o investimento foi escolhido pela sinergia com os objetivos da companhia de continuamente agregar valor, segurança e dados à operação de seus clientes por meio da gestão inteligente de frotas.</p><p id="""">A plataforma torna acessível a gestão do combustível a empresas de todos os portes de diferentes segmentos, o que antes, só era possível às grandes companhias. No atual cenário, o combustível representa um dos maiores custos para as empresas nos setores de transporte, mineração, construção, reflorestamento, entre outros.   Diante disso, a gestão se torna fundamental para evitar desperdício e desvio do combustível, e, consequentemente, reduzir os custos operacionais e aumentar a produtividade, lucratividade e competividade das empresas.</p><p id="""">Fábio Iunis de Paula, cofundador da Indicator Capital, explica que com as tecnologias anteriores, o processo de gestão de abastecimento era moroso e demandava uma infraestrutura complexa, além de instalação e manutenção presenciais nas empresas. Com a solução da CTA Smart, a gestão passa a ser remota, graças à conectividade direta com a nuvem, e há a possibilidade de instalação do dispositivo na bomba de abastecimento pelo próprio cliente. O gestor tem toda a operação na mão e consegue melhorar suas margens operacionais. Com isso, a CTA Smart está aprimorando a jornada do cliente, o que está em sinergia com os objetivos da Marcopolo.</p><p id=""""><a href=""https://www.abvcap.com.br/sala-de-imprensa/noticias-imprensa.aspx?c=pt-BR&id=5125"" id="""">Continue lendo</a></p>",2021-10-11,ABVCap,pt,https://www.abvcap.com.br/sala-de-imprensa/noticias-imprensa.aspx?c=pt-BR&id=5125,CTA Smart receives investment from Indicator Capital and Marcopolo to improve its system and expand internationally,"<p id=""""> Indicator Capital, a Brazilian early-stage venture capital manager, and Marcopolo, through its corporate venture capital and new business arm, MarcoZero, dedicated to monitoring, structuring and investing in opportunities in the area of mobility, announce the initial investment of R$5.5 million in CTA Smart, a technology company in the fuel segment focused on automation and supply control systems.

The platform will be accessible for fuel management for companies of all sizes and segments in Brazil and around the world, with robustness and ease of remote installation.</p><p id="""">CTA Smart's alignment with the thesis of Internet of Things was one of the determining factors for Indicator Capital's investment. As for MarcoZero, the investment was chosen due to its synergy with the company's objectives of continually adding value, security and data to its customers' operations through intelligent fleet management.</p><p id="""">The platform makes fuel management accessible to companies of all sizes in different segments, which was previously only possible for large companies. In the current scenario, fuel represents one of the biggest costs for companies in the transport, mining, construction, reforestation sectors, among others.   Given this, management becomes essential to avoid waste and diversion of fuel, and, consequently, reduce operational costs and increase the productivity, profitability and competitiveness of companies.</p><p id="""">Fábio Iunis de Paula , co-founder of Indicator Capital, explains that with previous technologies, the supply management process was time-consuming and required complex infrastructure, in addition to on-site installation and maintenance at companies. With the CTA Smart solution, management becomes remote, thanks to direct connectivity with the cloud, and there is the possibility of installing the device on the fuel pump by the customer. The manager has the entire operation in hand and is able to improve his operating margins. With this, CTA Smart is improving the customer journey, which is in synergy with Marcopolo's objectives.</p><p id=""""><a href=""https://www.abvcap.com. br/sala-de-imprensa/noticias-imprensa.aspx?c=pt-BR&id=5125"" id="""">Continue reading</a></p>"

The plans of LatAm’s largest venture capital fund for IoT investments,"<p id="""">  <em id="""">Launched in 2021, Indicator Capital’s Fundo 2 Indicator IoT claims to be the largest fund exclusively dedicated to early-stage Internet of Things (IoT) projects in Latin America.</em></p><p id=""""><em id="""">It kicked off with 240mn reais (US$45.8mn) in initial capital led by development bank BNDES and Qualcomm Ventures and complemented by Motorola, Lenovo, Telefónica and Banco do Brasil, among others. Indicator Capital was chosen as the manager of this fund.</em></p><p id=""""><em id="""">Since then, four companies have received investments, the latest being Beegol, which developed a machine learning-based platform to monitor and improve the quality of experience of broadband and Wi-Fi customers. A total of 22mn reais will be allocated to the company during 18 months.</em></p><p id=""""><em id="""">The fund plans to invest in 20-30 projects in five years, mostly series A but also seed capital rounds, Fabio Iunis de Paula, co-founder and general partner of Indicator Capital, tells BNamericas. The scenario is promising: IDC projects Brazil’s IoT market will generate US$1.6bn in investments this year alone, considering solutions and services, a growth of 17.6% year-over-year</em></p><p id=""""><em id="""">BNamericas spoke to Iunis de Paula about the opportunities in the IoT segment, the effects of macroeconomics and potential investments outside Brazil, among others.</em></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">BNamericas:</strong> The fund claims to be the largest dedicated to IoT in Latin America. In what way? How much cash do you currently have for investment?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">De Paula:</strong> Indicator was founded in 2014 and we officially launched our first fund in 2016. Through it, we made investments in 16 companies. </p><p id="""">Fund 2 came after we were selected in a public call by BNDES and Qualcomm Ventures to choose managers for a new fund dedicated exclusively to IoT, in the context of the [BNDES-promoted] national IoT plan.</p><p id="""">We launched the fund in May, initially with a target of 120mn reais, but we filed it with [market regulator] CVM with twice as much: 240mn reais. We ended up being able to reach this capital with a series of other investors, such as Motorola, Lenovo, 3G Radar, Telefónica, Banco do Brasil and Multilaser.</p><p id="""">I'm not aware of any other fund exclusively dedicated to this ecosystem this big, with 240mn reais of resources and the possibility of expansion with additional closings.</p><p id="""">We plan to invest in 20-30 projects in five years. Of these 20-30 companies, we have already made four investments: in Monuv, CTA, Infoprice and, now, Beegol.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">BNamericas:</strong> Will the fund be exclusively dedicated to the Brazilian market?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">De Paula:</strong> We were born in the context of the national IoT plan, with resources from Brazilian and multinational companies operating in Brazil.</p><p id="""">Our first “search yard” is Brazil. But that doesn't mean we won't be looking for investments in other countries as well. Besides, we are also investing in projects with opportunities for international expansion, as is the case, particularly, of CTA and Beegol.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">BNamericas:</strong> How will the up to 30 investments be divided over the period? Is there a rush to make these allocations?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">De Paula:</strong> We have incentives and goals to invest as quickly as possible. But we don't have an</p><p id="""">obligation. There is no rush. We want to find the best opportunities. But I'd say our goal is to make around six investments per year.</p><p id="""">If we can bring that 30 initial goal forward, it is even better. We have more time to work the companies out.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">BNamericas:</strong> Is this target upheld regardless of the economic outlook? How are you balancing these investments with macroeconomic issues, market volatility?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">De Paula:</strong> We are committed to making these investments, to go forward with them. But we also do take into account the entire macroeconomic environment to identify opportunities and value them according to the macro situation.</p><p id="""">Venture capital has a long investment cycle and we are usually investing in early-stage companies. So yes, we take into account the macroeconomic environment to understand the growth opportunity environment that these companies will have.</p><p id="""">But we also often say that bad macroeconomic cycles can be even more conducive to these</p><p id="""">investments.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">BNamericas:</strong> Have you noticed any trend reversals in the conversations for new closings or is it 'so far, so good'?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">De Paula:</strong> We are overall feeling a retraction in the market, in the sense of route correction. The</p><p id="""">valuations that were being paid two months ago are no longer the same as they are now. But I would say so far, so good.</p><p id="""">The market anticipated this course correction. We were in a cycle of equities boom, a very strong, very accelerated movement. Now we are seeing this correction. But there's no way to know. These things are uncertain. Forecasts also change very fast. This trend may soon turn around again.</p><p id="""">During these 10 years of Indicator Capital, we have invested considering these cycles. We invest according to the conjuncture, but we don't stop investing.</p><p id="""">And I would say that the opportunities in IoT are more detached from the macroeconomic issue. Digital transformation continues. It will continue and will accelerate. Now we have the 5G deployments... All this opens up many new opportunities.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">BNamericas:</strong> Within IoT, where are you seeing more opportunities? And which stage of companies’ development are you prioritizing?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">De Paula:</strong> We are mainly looking at the technologies, pillars of this ecosystem, whether it be artificial intelligence, sensors and devices, the whole part of 5G and mobility infrastructure. Obviously, all that within a safe environment. The whole security part is very important to us. We also consider a lot of socially driven investments and with a sustainability purpose.</p><p id="""">We mainly look at the sectors defined as key in the national plan for the internet of things: agriculture, industry 4.0, smart cities/mobility, and the health sector. But we are agnostic, we can invest in the financial sector, in retail, etc.</p><p id="""">Regarding the size of the companies, we have been trying to prioritize companies with at least an MVP [minimum viable product] and a more defined business model.</p><p id="""">Companies with an operating team, at a reasonably early stage of development. In general, our fund is dedicated to emerging companies earning up to 16mn reais per year.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">BNamericas:</strong> What are the main challenges and hurdles? What needs to be improved so the IoT ecosystem takes off?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">De Paula:</strong> The technology investment ecosystem has evolved a lot. It matured considerably in Brazil and in Latin America.

Indicator Capital e TM3 Capital investem R$ 15 milhões na startup InfoPrice,"<p id="""">  A InfoPrice, startup de tecnologia de inteligência de preços, acaba de receber um investimento de R$ 15 milhões. Deste total, R$ 10 milhões da Indicator Capital, são da gestora brasileira de venture capital e R$ 5 milhões da TM3 Capital, atual investidor da companhia. O software da Infoprice é destinado, principalmente, a supermercados e drogarias. A plataforma faz o monitoramento dos preços da concorrência e permite ao varejista um melhor posicionamento às condições de mercado de forma instantânea. Na prática, a plataforma traz para varejistas de maior porte o conceito da feira livre, onde os vendedores atualizam seus preços o em tempo real, de olho na demanda pelos produtos e nas barracas ao seu lado para não terminar com produtos encalhados na banca.</p><p id="""">Com o aporte, a InfoPrice vai aperfeiçoar seu sistema e torná-lo acessível a pequenos e médios negócios. O público-alvo da startup já está em transformação. Durante os primeiros seis anos da companhia, fundada em 2013, a startup conseguiu cerca de 30 clientes, que somavam faturamento de R$ 100 bilhões por ano. Já nos últimos 18 meses, a InfoPrice conseguiu alcançar 100 clientes, mirando empresas de R$ 50 milhões de faturamento por ano. “Com o investimento atual, queremos faturar R$ 100 milhões por ano até 2024.

In just over a year, since September 2020, Indicator Capital's first fund has registered four exits to corporations: Social Miner was sold to Locaweb (LWSA3), IOUU to Banco Letsbank, Threedy.ai to Nextech AR (NECF) and TEVEC to infra. commerce (IFCM3).</p><p id="""">According to the VC firm thesis, for large corporations to transform themselves digitally, they will need to hire and even acquire technology-based startups. Indicator invests in startups that drive corporate Digital Transformation.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Expertise in Digital Transformation to generate consistent returns</strong></p><p id="""" >Social Miner, specialized in technology and solutions for e-commerce companies and retailers, was acquired by Locaweb (B3: LWSA3) in September 2020. This was Indicator Capital's first exit and considered a representative milestone because it took place in less than three years . “In recent years, there have been numerous IPOs of corporations seeking to strengthen their Digital Transformation strategy. As a result, the search for partnerships, mergers and acquisitions with startups has increased significantly. Our funds are increasingly becoming a shopping center for Digital Transformation,” comments Thomas Bittar, founding partner of Indicator Capital, responsible for the investment deal in Social Miner.</p><p id="""">Subsequently, in April 2021, IOUU , a P2P lending platform for companies, was acquired by LetsBank. The fund participated in the entire development cycle of the startup. The second exit, also in record time, confirmed the heating up of the sector. “The fintech ecosystem has never been so heated and competitive. Large incumbent banks face a huge challenge coming from smaller and more agile financial institutions that are rapidly differentiating themselves through acquisitions of recent technologies,” comments Derek Bittar, founding partner of Indicator Capital, responsible for the investment deal in IOUU.</p>< p id="""">In June 2021, it was the turn of Threedy.ai, a California-based deep-tech solution, to be acquired by Nextech AR Solutions (CNSX: NEXCF). The startup uses state-of-the-art computational geometry and Artificial Intelligence to help large companies generate and scale 3D objects, enabling Augmented Reality more cost-effectively. “With our position in California, we are aware of what is most innovative in the world, and we are able to anticipate trends and better assess the right opportunities for Brazil. Although our first three exits took place on very tight deadlines, it is something we had already planned. Our expertise in Digital Transformation makes large corporations keep an eye on our investments,” comments Fabio Iunis de Paula, founding partner of Indicator Capital, responsible for the investment in Threedy.ai.</p><p id="""">And finally , in early 2022, TEVEC, a Machine Learning platform focused on Artificial Intelligence algorithms for Digital Transformation, was acquired by Infracommerce (B3: IFCM3). The company's solution enables the automation of analysis for decision making on supply, purchases, campaigns, and prices. Fabio Iunis de Paula, founding partner of Indicator Capital, was also responsible for this investment.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Launch of Fund 2 IoT drives Digital Transformation in strategic sectors</strong </p><p id="""">In the first half of 2021, the VC firm launched its second fund, Indicator 2 IoT, with an initial value of BRL 240M and the first specialized on the Internet of Things (IoT) in Latin America. Aimed at startups that develop services and products related to IoT and Connectivity, the fund promotes the National IoT Plan, accelerating technologies from strategic sectors for the country, such as Agriculture, Health, Industry 4.0, Smart Cities and Mobility. In a 10-year period, the fund will invest in up to 30 companies with a focus on the initial stage (Series A).

Indicator Capital, a Brazilian early-stage venture capital firm, is leading a US$ 2.2 million investment round in Beegol, a SaaS company that uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to monitor and improve the quality of services provided by broadband operators. Beegol's platform is the only one in the world that monitors the network “end to end”, including all the necessary components to provide excellent Quality of Experience (QoE) to the end customer while reducing operational costs to major ISPs and Telcos.</p><p id="""">This is the fourth contribution made through the Indicator 2 IoT Fund, the largest Internet of Things and Connectivity specialized fund in Latin America. The Series A round is expected to be completed within 18 months with an extra amount of US$ 2 million bringing the total investment to US$ 4.2 million.</p><p id="""">Founded in 2019, Beegol aims to improve the way Operators deliver broadband services, which are increasingly vital for the home, work, study and social environments such as gaming and video conferencing. ISPs and Telcos currently spend 6% to 10% of their annual net broadband revenue addressing technical issues, including call center interactions and truck rolls for repairs. As demand for reliable internet connection has dramatically increased over the last years, technical problems are now one of the main causes of customer complaints and higher costs. Beegol’s goal is to enable broadband operators to immediately locate, identify and fix issues anywhere in their network, thus increasing QoE and reducing operational, customer support and churn costs.</p><p id="""">To achieve this, Beegol has developed a Machine Learning platform that monitors, identifies, and locates problems in the network using data collected through a software agent embedded in the modem (telemetry) in real-time. This data then allows operators to anticipate and avoid future issues and self-heal issues that may be addressed immediately. Beegol’s agent collects data from all network components, including residential Wi-Fi, access network (cable or fiber), and throughout the transport layers and its key components such as DNS and CDN.</p><p id="""">With Beegol’s geo-location and mapping capabilities, operators are able to visually determine the source of degradation and service interruptions, and immediately determine if the issue impacts a single subscriber or impacts various subscribers on a certain node or nodes. The platform is scalable to tens of millions of customers and is fully software driven (no hardware required), hardware-agnostic, and deployed over the air to modems already in the field. </p><p id="""">The Beegol team's expertise in the technology and telecommunications sectors and the capacity to solve issues that occur not only in Brazil but throughout the world (the quality of Internet and Wi-Fi services) were some of the factors that led Indicator Capital to invest in the startup, which has a presence in São Paulo, Los Angeles, New York and with a new office in Europe.</p><p id="""">Indicator Capital co-founder, Fábio Iunis de Paula, highlights that “Beegol has enormous growth potential, not only in Brazil but internationally, as it operates in a giant market and solves the pain that is the vulnerable point of the telecommunications infrastructure and Internet around the world. The technology can identify the source of the problem and solve it efficiently only with the AI software embedded in the modem. The virtualization of network functions is a <em id="""">megatrend</em> in the telecommunications sector, as it happened in data communication, solving, through software, many issues that were previously hardware-dependent”.</p><p id="""">The evolution of 5G technology, the Internet of Things, and the continuity of a large volume of people conducting their activities at home, even with the post-pandemic return, also contribute to the company's development. There are more devices connected in a network, liable to failure and requiring continuous monitoring.</p><p id="""">Beegol’s CSO and co-founder Charles Hong, “operators and subscribers world-wide share the pain of broadband and Wi-Fi connectivity issues. While the hardware installed in most homes today have evolved into quite robust computing systems, the software and diagnostics capability currently available to them are in great need of improvement. We fill this gap and help operators maximize the heavy investments made in the customer premise devices (CPEs) by providing a solution that can be sent out to the modems over the air and immediately start to deliver results for the customer and the operator. The path is towards zero calls to call centers due to technical issues, as the operator’s hardware and Beegol’s machine learning software should identify issues before a customer ever has to call”. </p><p id="""">For the founder and CEO of Beegol, Gilberto Mayor, “Beegol's entirely software-based platform solves this challenge holistically and puts the data in the hands of the operator with no need to change legacy systems thus it can be quickly deployed anywhere in the world. The investment and partnership with Indicator accelerate our globalization process”.</p><p id="""">Once the investment is completed, Indicator Capital will use its expertise and international presence by applying at Beegol its proprietary methodology Building Value Together®, especially the Cross-Border pillar, focused on business development with global companies and investors. Simultaneously, the VC manager will also apply the other three pillars of the methodology: connection with the ecosystem, 'hands on' approach and collaboration to generate new businesses, development supporting innovation and investments, contributing to Governance and management, and helping to promote pilot projects and POCs with clients for revenue generation.</p><p id="""">Beegol is also aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) metrics, especially with item 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure). “The technology offered by Beegol, in addition to bringing innovation, makes it possible to make the telecom infrastructure more resilient and sustainable”, concludes Fabio Iunis de Paula.</p><p id="""">  <strong id="""">About </strong><a href=""https://indicatorcapital.com/"" id=""""><strong id="""">Indicator Capital</strong></a></p><p id="""">Founded in 2014, Indicator Capital is a Brazilian venture capital firm operating in Sao Paulo and the Silicon Valley.

Indicator Capital, a Brazilian early-stage venture capital firm, is leading a US$2.2 million investment round in Beegol, a SaaS company that uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to monitor and improve the quality of services provided by broadband operators. Beegol's platform is the only one in the world that monitors the network “end to end”, including all the necessary components to provide excellent Quality of Experience (QoE) to the end customer while reducing operational costs to major ISPs and Telcos.</p ><p id="""">This is the fourth contribution made through the Indicator 2 IoT Fund, the largest Internet of Things and Connectivity specialized fund in Latin America. The Series A round is expected to be completed within 18 months with an extra amount of US$ 2 million bringing the total investment to US$ 4.2 million.</p><p id="""">Founded in 2019, Beegol aims to improve the way Operators deliver broadband services, which are increasingly vital for the home, work, study and social environments such as gaming and video conferencing. ISPs and Telcos currently spend 6% to 10% of their annual net broadband revenue addressing technical issues, including call center interactions and truck rolls for repairs. As demand for reliable internet connection has dramatically increased over the last years, technical problems are now one of the main causes of customer complaints and higher costs. Beegol's goal is to enable broadband operators to immediately locate, identify and fix issues anywhere in their network, thus increasing QoE and reducing operational, customer support and churn costs.</p><p id="""">To achieve this, Beegol has developed a Machine Learning platform that monitors, identifies, and locates problems in the network using data collected through a software agent embedded in the modem (telemetry) in real-time. This data then allows operators to anticipate and avoid future issues and self-heal issues that can be addressed immediately. Beegol's agent collects data from all network components, including residential Wi-Fi, access network (cable or fiber), and throughout the transport layers and its key components such as DNS and CDN.</p><p id="""">With Beegol's geo-location and mapping capabilities, operators are able to visually determine the source of degradation and service interruptions, and immediately determine if the issue impacts a single subscriber or impacts multiple subscribers on a certain node or nodes. The platform is scalable to tens of millions of customers and is fully software driven (no hardware required), hardware-agnostic, and deployed over the air to modems already in the field. </p><p id="""">The Beegol team's expertise in the technology and telecommunications sectors and the capacity to solve issues that occur not only in Brazil but throughout the world (the quality of Internet and Wi-Fi services) were some of the factors that led Indicator Capital to invest in the startup, which has a presence in São Paulo, Los Angeles, New York and with a new office in Europe.</p><p id="""">Indicator Capital co-founder , Fábio Iunis de Paula, highlights that “Beegol has enormous growth potential, not only in Brazil but internationally, as it operates in a giant market and solves the pain that is the vulnerable point of the telecommunications infrastructure and Internet around the world. The technology can identify the source of the problem and solve it efficiently only with the AI ​​software embedded in the modem. The virtualization of network functions is a <em id="""">megatrend</em> in the telecommunications sector, as it happened in data communication, solving, through software, many issues that were previously hardware-dependent.”</p> <p id="""">The evolution of 5G technology, the Internet of Things, and the continuity of a large volume of people conducting their activities at home, even with the post-pandemic return, also contribute to the company's development. There are more devices connected in a network, liable to failure and requiring continuous monitoring.</p><p id="""">Beegol's CSO and co-founder Charles Hong, “operators and subscribers world-wide share the pain of broadband and Wi-Fi connectivity issues. While the hardware installed in most homes today has evolved into quite robust computing systems, the software and diagnostics capabilities currently available to them are in great need of improvement. We fill this gap and help operators maximize the heavy investments made in the customer premise devices (CPEs) by providing a solution that can be sent out to the modems over the air and immediately start to deliver results for the customer and the operator. The path is towards zero calls to call centers due to technical issues, as the operator’s hardware and Beegol’s machine learning software should identify issues before a customer ever has to call”. </p><p id="""">For the founder and CEO of Beegol, Gilberto Mayor, “Beegol's entirely software-based platform solves this challenge holistically and puts the data in the hands of the operator with no need to change legacy systems thus it can be quickly deployed anywhere in the world. The investment and partnership with Indicator accelerate our globalization process.”</p><p id="""">Once the investment is completed, Indicator Capital will use its expertise and international presence by applying at Beegol its proprietary methodology Building Value Together®, especially the Cross-Border pillar, focused on business development with global companies and investors. Simultaneously, the VC manager will also apply the other three pillars of the methodology: connection with the ecosystem, 'hands on' approach and collaboration to generate new businesses, development supporting innovation and investments, contributing to Governance and management, and helping to promote pilot projects and POCs with clients for revenue generation.</p><p id="""">Beegol is also aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) metrics, especially with item 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure). “The technology offered by Beegol, in addition to bringing innovation, makes it possible to make the telecom infrastructure more resilient and sustainable”, concludes Fabio Iunis de Paula.</p><p id=""""> <strong id="""" >About</strong><a href=""https://indicatorcapital.com/"" id=""""><strong id="""">Indicator Capital</strong></a></p><p id= """">Founded in 2014, Indicator Capital is a Brazilian venture capital firm operating in Sao Paulo and the Silicon Valley.

Together, both companies are investing BRL 17 million. The remaining amount of the round is being complemented by other national and international venture capital funds and a group of angel investors.</p><p id="""">The contribution will help to further accelerate the growth of the platform and the entry of Rúmi, Rúmina's Artificial Intelligence, which has already been helping thousands of farms in their management, disease detection, credit taking and production traceability. ""We have the largest and most relevant database on the Brazilian livestock chain and our services are contributing to improving the productivity efficiency of thousands of farms of all sizes. With the investment, we will be able to further consolidate our growth by expanding the range of solutions that will positively impact the sector, in a sustainable way”, says Marcelo Ferreira, co-founder of Rúmina.</p><p id="""">Rúmina's vision is to help livestock farmers around the world use technology to reduce the environmental impact of the activity, increase farm productivity and lead the digital transformation of the sector, in addition to contributing to animal welfare in more than 300 thousand livestock farms in Brazil and Latin America in the next 10 years.</p><p id =""""><em id="""">“The future of global livestock is about improving animal health and sustainability. By managing more than 10% of Brazilian milk, in 2021 we avoided the use of almost 230 thousand doses of antibiotics and the disposal of more than 7 million liters of milk.

We are convinced that this market in Brazil will quickly become more technical and thus even more efficient and competitive, at the same time less polluting”, explains Flavio Zaclis, founder of Barn Investimentos. “Consumers will increasingly demand transparency, traceability and control over the animal's production and breeding processes. We believe that the path to this necessarily involves the adoption of technology in the field and surroundings. We are also convinced that the producer and the dairy and beef chains want highly integrated technology solutions, that solve different problems on the same unified and integrated platform, as is the case with Rumina. We believe in Rumina's project, potential and strategy to become the most important technology company for the livestock market”,</em> concludes Flavio.</p><p id="""">For Fabio Iunis de Paula, co-founder of Indicator Capital, <em id="""">“Rúmina's technology contributes decisively to the evolution of the agricultural sector in Brazil, taking advantage of the increasing connectivity between people and devices to generate intelligence. The use of IoT solutions allows not only to bring great efficiency and productivity, but also to promote sustainability in the field with a more humanized production.”</em></p><p id="""">Throughout 2021, Rúmina also strengthened its relationship with the industry, closing partnerships with Danone, Vigor, Scala and Verde Campo, among other major players in the sector.</p><p id="""">In November 2021, Danone and Rúmina joined forces - through the 'Mais Leite Saudável' Program (PMLS), of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply (MAPA) - to assist 60 farms with the identification of the cause of mastitis within 24 hours, in the field itself, through microbiological culture.

InfoPrice recebe aporte de R$ 15 mi para levar precificação dinâmica a pequenos e médios lojistas,"<p id="""">  A precificação dinâmica, feita com base em informações sobre concorrentes e até contexto e perfil de quem está comprando, já é uma realidade no comércio eletrônico há algum tempo. Mas em pleno 2021, continua sendo um desafio para donos e donas de lojas físicas, principalmente aqueles de pequeno e médio portes – principalmente por conta do custo atrelado ao uso dessas tecnologias.</p><p id="""">Mas esse cenário pode mudar se os esforços da InfoPrice surtirem o resultado esperado. A companhia que completa 8 anos nesta semana, e que já fez parte da antiga B2W (hoje Americanas), acaba de levantar uma rodada de R$ 15 milhões para turbinar o plano de tornar a precificação dinâmica mais acessível ao varejo.</p><p id="""">O aporte foi liderado pela Indicator Capital, com R$ 10 milhões de seu fundo de internet das coisas, e foi complementado pela TM3 Capital, do fundador da Bematech, Marcel Malczewski, que já era investidora da companhia desde 2018.     </p><p id="""">A estratégia de crescimento, que já está em curso, tem surtido efeito. Segundo Paulo Garcia, cofundador e presidente da companhia, o número de clientes atendidos, que em praticamente toda a história da operação ficou na faixa de 30 grandes nomes, agora em outubro chegou a 100 por conta da ampliação do leque para negócios menores.</p><p id="""">Outra mudança foi a redução no ciclo de vendas, que está em 30 dias, uma vez que as redes menores conseguem fechar contratos mais rapidamente. O varejo alimentar e farmácias e drogarias são as principais áreas de atuação, mas ela também tem clientes nos segmentos de eletro, home center, entre outros.</p><p id="""">Como resultado da ampliação do foco, a receita nos últimos 12 meses – medida em caráter recorrente, por se tratar de uma oferta no modelo de assinatura – dobrou, chegando a R$ 20 milhões. Para o ano todo, o valor deve mais que dobrar. E a ideia é manter esse ritmo. “O plano é agressivo. A gente sabe que o mercado potencial é gigantesco.

But in 2021, it continues to be a challenge for owners of physical stores, especially small and medium-sized ones – mainly due to the cost linked to the use of these technologies.</p><p id="""">But this scenario could change if InfoPrice's efforts yield the expected results. The company, which turns 8 years old this week, and which was once part of the former B2W (now Americanas), has just raised a round of R$15 million to boost its plan to make dynamic pricing more accessible to retailers.</p> <p id="""">The contribution was led by Indicator Capital, with R$ 10 million from its internet of things fund, and was complemented by TM3 Capital, from Bematech's founder, Marcel Malczewski, who had already been an investor in the company since 2018. </p><p id="""">The growth strategy, which is already underway, has had an effect. According to Paulo Garcia, co-founder and president of the company, the number of customers served, which in practically the entire history of the operation was in the range of 30 big names, now in October reached 100 due to the expansion of the range to smaller businesses.</ p><p id="""">Another change was the reduction in the sales cycle, which is now 30 days, as smaller chains are able to close contracts more quickly. Food retail and pharmacies and drugstores are the main areas of activity, but it also has customers in the electrical and home center segments, among others.</p><p id="""">As a result of the expansion of focus, revenue in the last 12 months – measured on a recurring basis, as it is a subscription model offer – it doubled, reaching R$20 million. For the entire year, the value should more than double. And the idea is to maintain this pace. “The plan is aggressive. We know that the potential market is gigantic. We have a robust commercial machine and we want to expand that”, says Paulo. For him, the current scenario of uncertainty in the economy and rising inflation only reinforces the need for this type of investment on the part of retailers. </p><p id="""">According to Thomas Bittar, partner at Indicator responsible for investment, the expansion route also involves acquisitions and market consolidation to give the business more muscle and prepare it for fundraising more robust soon.</p><p id=""""><a href=""https://startups.com.br/noticias/infoprice-recebe-aporte-de-r-15-mi-para-levar -dynamic-pricing-a-small-and-medium-sized-retailers/"" id="""">Continue reading</a></p>"

Deep tech brasileira para dar energia à indústria 4.0,"<p id="""">  Um total de 27 bilhões. Esse é o número de dispositivos de Internet das Coisas que devem estar conectados até 2025. Todos esses aparelhos demandam uma fonte de energia. Uma opção é o uso de baterias. A startup brasileira IBBX propõe uma solução alternativa: a captura de energia perdida no ar. A tecnologia criada pela deep tech nacional consegue reciclar a energia proveniente de ondas eletromagnéticas para carregar sensores e equipamentos. Tudo sem fio. Com um encaixe perfeito com as demandas do segmento IoT, a grande aposta é aplicar os produtos para alavancar a indústria 4.0.</p><p id="""">A solução da startup se baseia na tecnologia de Energy Harvesting, que foca nos sinais eletromagnéticos de baixa frequência. O processo captura e armazena energia derivada de fontes externas para utilizá-la para outros fins. A sacada surgiu da vontade de Luís Fernando Destro, cofundador e CEO da IBBX, de solucionar as perdas de energia das máquinas. A resposta foi a reciclagem energética. “Eu trabalhava em uma empresa do ramo de construção industrial. Os instaladores de equipamentos de automação sempre falavam que os painéis elétricos estavam com interferência. Essa interferência vinha dos motores. Analisei o problema e vi que existia uma quantidade absurda de energia perdida em um motor industrial. São perdidos megawatts de energia em ondas eletromagnéticas. Então, comecei a estudar como capturar essas ondas”, explica o CEO.</p><p id="""">A solução pode ser aplicada a diversos produtos, como o carregamento de celulares e câmeras de vigilância. Foram realizados alguns protótipos. Já são mais de 10 patentes depositadas. A IBBX encontrou uma oportunidade de gerar receita no segmento de IoT, especialmente o industrial. O mercado de Internet das Coisas deve saltar dos US$ 478.36 bilhões de 2022 para US$ 2.465.26 bilhões, em 2029. Os dados são da Fortune Business Insights. O setor tem dois gargalos: energia e conectividade. A solução da IBBX consegue resolver ambos. Por isso, os fundadores optaram por começar a atuar com um foco na indústria 4.0 – para a startup, o conceito não se limita à manufatura.

With more than R$500 million under management, TM3 Capital, created in 2011, has already invested in 41 startups. Of the total, 22% are from the AI ​​area. “We have around R$200 million to invest in the sector, until the first quarter of 2027”, he states. Over the next two years, the plan, according to the executive, is to support up to five companies, in four niches: logistics, retail, health and agribusiness.</p><p id="""">TM3 Capital's biggest checks in companies AI went to InfoPrice, a retail price intelligence company, with R$14 million in 2018; and Docket, for document management, which received R$16 million this year.</p><p id="""">At Indicator Capital, one of the most recent movements in the AI ​​industry took place at the end of 2021, with the injection of R$11 million into Beegol. The machine learning-based platform uses technology to monitor customer experience with telecom operators' services, such as broadband and wireless networks.</p><p id="""">“We evaluate the potential for sustainable financial growth and the socio-environmental impact of startups to ensure that they will transform into large and responsible companies”, says Derek Bittar, co-founder of Indicator Capital. The manager has invested in 22 startups since 2016, the majority (72.3%) or 16 of which are in the AI ​​area. By 2024, the expectation is to fund up to ten companies in the sector, mainly those with solutions for smart cities, health, agribusiness and industry 4.0. “As in any business, the product needs to sell and the startup must make money.”</p><p id="""">That's what Paulo Lerner, CEO of Rio's Syos, a refrigerator management platform that uses AI and internet of things (IoT) to guarantee the right temperature in equipment and minimize losses. The company founded in 2019 had revenues of R$8 million in 2021 and plans to reach R$15 million in revenue by the end of the year. The client portfolio increased from 15 companies, in November 2021, to the current 50.</p><p id="""">In April 2022, the startup received R$12 million from Indicator Capital. The investment will be used to hire commercial teams, finance marketing and publicity, says Lerner, who serves groups such as Coca-Cola, Metalfrio and Zona Sul supermarkets. At the beginning of 2023, the idea is to raise another R$12 million, says the entrepreneur, which plans to expand operations in the pharmaceutical industry, which is adept at refrigerating sensitive medicines.</p><p id="""">Other startups in the sector, recently invested, are also increasing the number of contracts. Looqbox, which uses AI to query large volumes of data, received a R$15 million ticket this year in a round led by DGF Investimentos. In 12 months, it gained ten clients and now there are 34, such as Via Varejo and Magalu. “We have a presence in retail and have started to expand in the finance and health verticals”, says CEO Rodrigo Murta.</p><p id="""">At unico, only in the area of ​​identity verification through facial recognition, the number of customers rose 32%, from 184, in November 2021, to 243. Considered a unicorn (startup valued at more than US$1 billion) since last year, the company that serves Pernambucanas and C6 Bank wants to expand its portfolio . “We invested R$1 million in a partnership with the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR) for work focused on identity authentication that only analyzes the eye region”, says unico’s CEO, Diego Martins.</p>< p id="""">By: Jacilio Saraiva (Valor Econômico)</p><p id=""""><a href=""https://valor.globo.com/publicacoes/suplementos/noticia/2022/11/ 28/investidor-aposta-em-startup-que-resolve-a-dor-do-cliente.ghtml"" id="""">Read -&gt;</a></p>"
